  /**
   * The BakerGC garbage collector is used for managing memory in the young
   * generation.
   *
   * The BakerGC takes advantage of the fact that most newly created objects
   * will die young. As a result, most objects encountered when collecting the
   * young generation will be garbage; this makes it efficient to copy the
   * surviving objects to a new location, and then reclaim the memory from the
   * collected area in one step.
   *
   * Memory for the young generation is thus split into three spaces:
   * - the Eden space, where new objects are initially allocated;
   * - the Current space, where young objects that have survived at least one
   *   collection (but not enough for promotion to the mature generation) are
   *   located; and
   * - the Next space, where surviving objects from the Eden and Current spaces
   *   will be copied on the next collection.
   *
   * When a young generation collection is required, the garbage collector
   * scans the Eden and Current spaces. When it finds a live object, it either
   * copies it to the Next space, or promotes it to the mature generation,
   * depending on how many collections it has survived.
   *
   * On the rare occasions that there is insufficient space in the Next space to
   * hold all surviving young objects during a collection, then all remaining
   * live young objects are promoted directly to the mature generation.
   *
   * At completion, the allocation pointer is reset in both the Eden and
   * Current spaces, and then the Current and Next spaces are swapped.
